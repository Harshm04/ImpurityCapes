# ImpurityCapes
A Minecraft capes mod which gives Impurity players a special cape

# Setting Up
## This mod requires a few steps before it gets to be used. You will need to perform a few steps:
* First of all you must set an API key. Simply do /api new and it will give you a UUID. Click on it as it will add it to your chatbox. Copy it and set it using **/ic key <key>**
* Second, you must cache the impurity members. Just do **/ic cache** and it will do the job. Your game may freeze for a few seconds, but should be fast.
That's pretty much it, you will not need to do those steps again, however the mod will not work if not set up correctly.

## Commands:
* /ic toggle - Toggles the mod
* /ic key - Sets the API key
* /ic cache - Caches the impurity members
